### Problem

The stock prices of companies in the same sector appear to respond to events with a direct correlation. The goal of this project is to build models to analyze whether this feature could be exploited to advantage in the markets. 

**Stakeholders**: Private Investors, Investment firms and Hedge funds.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPI)**: To be decided.

**Data sets**: We will build the model using the stock prices of a few companies in the following sectors.

1. Retail
2. Banks
3. Semiconductor
4. A few large companies from the S and P 500 index.
5. Pharmaceuticals and healthcare.

We will scrape daily stock price data from `Yahoo Finance`?
