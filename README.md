### Problem

The stock prices of companies in the same sector appear to respond to events with a direct correlation. The goal of this project is to build models to analyze whether this feature could be exploited to advantage in the markets. 

**Stakeholders**: Private Investors, Investment firms and Hedge funds.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPI)**:
1. Having some insights about stock price data within each sector. (data pre-processing and EDA)
2. Having a pool of candidates of models to investigate. Those models should be reasonable to analyze stock market data.
3. The most ideal goal is to have a model that indicates that sympathy play as a factor would be statistically significant or improve predictability. If not, we would at least be able to conclude that under our assumptions and data we can acquire, sympathy play is not valid.
4. We will provide interpretations of our results.

**Data sets**: We will build the model using the stock prices of a few companies in the following sectors.

1. Retail
2. Banks
3. Semiconductor
4. A few large companies from the S and P 500 index.
5. Pharmaceuticals and healthcare.
6. Airlines

We will scrape daily stock price data from `Yahoo Finance`.

**Modeling Approach**:
Fill in here after 5/24 meeting.
